# 🐾 Habio

**Habio** is a gamified habit tracker where users build better routines by creating themed habit rooms, each with their own pet companion. Strengthen your habits, unlock new creatures, and compete with friends to grow your personal habit world.

> 🎯 Your habits feed your pet. Your pet reflects your progress.

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 🧩 Rooms
Habit spaces organized by themes (e.g. Fitness, Learning, Wellness), each with its own:

- Pet companion
- Habit list
- Progress tracking
- Social sharing

### 🐶 Pets
Each pet is unique and tied to a specific room. Pets have:

- **Personalities** (e.g. shy, active, curious)
- **Preferences** (e.g. loves running, dislikes junk food)
- **Feelings** that react to your performance
- **Mechanics**: pets evolve, get energized, or become moody based on your habit consistency

### 🧠 Feelings & Emotions
Pets show emotional feedback depending on your habit activity. Their behavior motivates you to keep your streaks alive.

### 👥 Social & Competitive
- Share rooms with friends
- Compete in **habit challenges**
- Track your group streaks
- Show off your pet’s evolution
